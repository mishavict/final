  <li><a href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/jerboa">Encyclopaedia Britannica</a>: "jerboa, any of 33 species of long-tailed leaping rodents well adapted to the deserts and steppes of eastern Europe, Asia, and northern Africa. Jerboas are mouselike, with bodies ranging from 5 to 15 cm (2 to 5.9 inches) in length and long tails of 7 to 25 cm. Certain traits are highly variable between species, particularly the size of the ears, which range from small and round to slender and rabbitlike or remarkably large and broad. Hind toes number from three to five, but all species have short forelegs and extremely long hind legs. The tail is often tufted. Jerboas’ dense fur is either silky or velvety in texture and light in colour, usually matching the ground of the animal’s habitat."</li>

  <li><a href="https://a-z-animals.com/animals/jerboa/">Jerboa Facts</a>: "Surprisingly, for desert creatures, jerboas are animals that don’t drink water. Instead, the plants and insects they consume give them the hydration they need."</li>
	<br>
	<li><a href="https://www.desertusa.com/animals/jerboa.html">The Jerboa</a>: "The jerboa's range extends from Asia west southwestward across northern Africa. It often favors arid sandy habitats such as the Gobi Desert, where temperatures may fall to near zero during the cold of winter, and the Sahara Desert, where temperatures may rise to more than 130 degrees Fahrenheit in the heat of summer. Foraging primarily at night, the jerboa eats plants, seeds and insects, depending on its food to meet its need for water. It may never actually drink free water throughout its life."</li>

	<li><a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/for-rodent-week-the-gift-of-jerboas/">For Rodent Week, the Gift of Jerboas</a>: "Jerboas are specialised for saltation, or leaping. Despite a body length of mostly around 10 cm, jerboas can cover about 3 m in a single leap. This is a neat and useful trick if you want to cross large distances on hot sand, but of course jerboas are mostly nocturnal, and the predominant function of saltation in jerboas is to move quickly away from predators. One species – the Rough-legged jerboa Dipus sagitta – exhibits particularly interesting predator-avoidance behaviour: it not only leaps from predators, but, as it leaps, grabs at over-hanging foliage with its teeth and forelimbs, and then clambers into the vegetation to hide"</li>
